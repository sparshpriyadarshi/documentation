# WorkstreamEvent

This is a Shadow Activity event:  This is used to for 2 collections the internal Shadow Activity collection and the Shadow Activity Collection.  The Internal Shadow Activity will me just a massive growing and shrinkling persisted list activity event that will endup getting rolled up into Workstream summaries. When we roll up the internalWorkstreamEvent events we will do a ton of filtering and only take the highly relevant events and turn them into WorkstreamEvent (these will be used to create a reference to the workstream summary, so we can know what event were used to generate the summary and vise versa).  A Shadow Activity model is a collection of a ton of small interactions with the plugins (copy/paste/file open/file close/tab changed/...etc events) that will also enable use to know what materials are being used to funnel them into our engine to show highly relevant data according to your given flow.
